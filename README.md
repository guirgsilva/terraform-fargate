# Terraform Fargate Project

This project uses Terraform to provision and manage AWS resources for deploying a containerized application using AWS Fargate.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to automate the deployment of an application on AWS Fargate using Terraform. This includes creating necessary infrastructure such as VPC, subnets, security groups, ECS cluster, and task definitions.

## Files

### `main.tf`
This file is the entry point for the Terraform configuration. It includes the provider configuration and calls the other module files.

### `variables.tf`
This file defines the input variables for the Terraform configuration. It allows customization of the deployment by setting values for parameters such as region, VPC CIDR, and instance types.

### `outputs.tf`
This file defines the output values that are generated by the Terraform configuration. These outputs include information such as the ECS cluster name and the service URL.

### `vpc.tf`
This file contains the configuration for creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.

### `security_groups.tf`
This file defines the security groups that control the inbound and outbound traffic for the resources.

### `ecs_cluster.tf`
This file sets up the ECS cluster and the associated resources such as task definitions and services.

### `iam_roles.tf`
This file defines the IAM roles and policies required for the ECS tasks and services to interact with other AWS services.

### `alb.tf`
This file configures the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that distributes traffic to the ECS tasks.

## Application

The application deployed by this project is a containerized service running on AWS Fargate. The specifics of the application can be customized by modifying the task definitions and container configurations in the `ecs_cluster.tf` file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
3. Review and customize the variables in `variables.tf`.
4. Apply the Terraform configuration: `terraform apply`

## Requirements

- Terraform 0.12 or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
